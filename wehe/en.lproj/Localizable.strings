"Consent Text" = "Northeastern University, College of Computer and Information Science\n\nName of Investigator: David Choffnes\n\nTitle of Project: Identifying network traffic differentiation from mobile devices\n\n Request to Participate in Research\n\n We would like to invite you to take part in a research project. The purpose of this research study is to understand how cellular Internet providers give different performance to different network traffic from your smartphone. For example, we would like to know if a provider is speeding up YouTube traffic and/or slowing down Netflix. Northeastern University researchers will use this information to understand how often this occurs, where this occurs and what are the implications.\n\nWe are asking you to participate in this study because you are a smartphone user who has installed our app for detecting traffic differentiation. The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary. You do not have to participate and you can uninstall the app at any time. Even if you begin using the app, you can stop at any time. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate.\n\nYou can run tests from the app as many or as few times as you like. We would like you to run tests on different networks that you mobile device connects to, and at different times of day.\n\nThe possible risks or discomforts of the study are minimal. When you use the app, we will record the traffic it generates (including timestamps) and use this data to determine whether your Internet service provider (ISP) is interfering with your network traffic in any way. If available, we will collect information about your network, signal strength, operating system, and coarse-grained location (no more precise than a 1km radius of your location). Data concerning the network performance you receive while running tests (including timestamps), as well as information about your network, signal strength, operating system and jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, province) will be anonymized and made publicly available so that others can reproduce our findings. All other data will be shared only with co-investigators, and it will not be annotated with any personally identifiable information.\n\nThere are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. However, by running the app you may help us learn more about how ISPs interfere with Internet traffic from mobile devices. You will not be paid for your participation in this study.\n\nYour part in this study is anonymous to the researcher(s). However, because of the nature of Internet traffic, it is possible that participants could be identified by the IP address or other electronic records associated with the response. We will anonymize any IP addresses that could be used to identify you once we have processed the data to detect differentiation. Any reports or publications based on this research will use only group data and will not identify you or any individual as being affiliated with this project.\n\nIf you have any questions about this study, please feel free to e-mail the project team at wehe@ccs.neu.edu, and the person mainly responsible for the research will respond.\n\nIf you have any questions about your rights in this research, you may contact Nan C. Regina, Director, Human Subject Research Protection, 360 Huntington Avenue, Mail Stop 560-177, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115. Tel: 617.373.4588, Email: n.regina@neu.edu. You may call anonymously if you wish.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding electronic privacy, please feel free to contact Mark Nardone, NU’s Director of Information Security via phone at 617-373-7901, or via email at privacy@neu.edu.\n\nThis study has been reviewed and approved by the Northeastern University Institutional Review Board (#14-08-16).\n\nBy clicking the \"accept\” button below you are indicating that you consent to participate in this study. Please print out a copy of this consent form for your records.\n\n";

"DPI Info Text" = "DPI stands for Deep Packet Inspection, where the ISP looks into your packets to find certain keywords. This analysis determines what keyword your ISP is using to determine whether to throttle this app.\n\nThis will require multiple tests to complete and about 1GB of data, may also take more than an hour to finish.";

"AboutText" = "Have you ever wondered if your Internet service provider is slowing down certain apps relative to others? Unfortunately, your mobile device and carriers currently give you little or no way to tell if this is the case. With Wehe, we give you a way to test if this is happening to the Internet traffic generated by popular apps.\n\nWehe is brought to you by researchers at Northeastern University and UMass Amherst. By running Wehe tests, you contribute to a global database of tests that help us understand where and how net neutrality is violated. We use this data to promote a free and open Internet. You can see a summary of this data by clicking on the View Online Dashboard option in the menu.";

"FunctionalityText" = "Differentiation tests\n\nWehe uses your device to exchange Internet traffic recorded from real, popular apps like YouTube and Spotify---effectively making it look as if you are using those apps. As a result, if an Internet service provider (ISP) tries to slow down an YouTube, Wehe would see the same behavior. We then send the same app's Internet traffic, but replacing the content with randomized bytes, which prevents the ISPs from classifying the traffic as belonging to the app. Our hypothesis is that the randomized traffic will not cause an ISP to conduct application-specific differentiation (e.g., throttling or blocking), but the original traffic will. We repeat these tests several times to rule out noise from bad network conditions, and tell you at the end whether your ISP is giving different performance to an app's network traffic.\n\nPort tests \n\n The Port Test allows users to check the performance of 12 frequently used ports. The test is done by comparing performance of running https traffic for each of these ports against the traffic for port 443, which is used as the baseline. The test is offered with two different settings, using 10 MB or 50 MB data per test (beware of data consumption for mobile tests).";
